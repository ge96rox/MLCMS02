# MLCMS02

## Usage
This repo contains a submodule named Vadere, an open-source framework for simulating microscopic pedestrian and crowd dynamics.
Vadere has been developed by Prof. Dr. Gerta KÃ¶ster's research group at the Munich University of Applied Sciences at the department for Computer Science and Mathematics. We have extended the Vadere with SIR model. At the first time you clone this repo, you need to update the submodule with the command:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
